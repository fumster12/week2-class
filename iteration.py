# Let's learn about lists and iteration so we can automate things.

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)


# 1. CODE-ALONG: Use a while loop (or a repeat loop) to simplify our code.





# 2. CODE-ALONG: Use a for loop (combined with a range) to generalize our code.




# 3. CHALLENGE: Choose a list structure and a looping construct to automate this code as much as you can:

# print("Wrigley Field")
# print("The Bean")
# print("The John Hancock Tower")
# print("The United Center")
# print("The Shakespeare Theater")


# 4. CHALLENGE: Write a function that accepts a list of landmark names you want to visit
# and displays the total cost of the trip.  Use the cost information from functions.py.


# 5. CHALLENGE: Go back to warmup.py, and enhance the code so that
# the user can keep guessing until they get it right.
